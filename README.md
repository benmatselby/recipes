# Family recipes

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/fc79413f-c86c-42d7-9238-c72f45b407fe/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/bms-recipes/deploys)

This started out all written down. However, you're in the supermarket and cannot remember the ingredients - nightmare. A website just makes more sense. It became a learning tool to implement something in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

This site uses the following tech:

- Node.js 16+ (If you use `nvm` you can run `nvm use` to get the correct version).
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org)
- [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/)
- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)

## Getting the site running

To get the site running locally, clone the repo and install the dependencies.

```shell
npm install
```

Then you can run the dev server.

```shell
npm run dev
```
