This makes 6 large puddings.

## Ingredients

- 200ml of milk
- 80g of flour
- pinch of salt
- 2 large eggs

## Method

- Put a little bit of oil in a pudding tray, should cover the bottom.
- Put in the oven and heat the oven on the highest for 20 minutes.
- Mix the milk, flour, and eggs together.
- Beat the mixture, the longer the better.
- Place in the tray and cook for 30 minutes.
- After 15 minutes, very quickly open the door and close it. This lets the moisture out, so the puddings should firm up.
