## Ingredients

- 6 to 8 sausages
- 1 tablespoon of garlic paste
- 2 tablespoons of tomato paste
- Small tub of Philadelphia (or equivalent cream cheese)
- 1 pack of cherry tomatoes, halved
- Broccoli
- 300g of fusilli pasta

## Method

- Cut the broccoli into florets.
- Boil the pasta and the broccoli in the same pan until its almost soft. We will continue to cook the pasta with the sausages.
- Meanwhile cut the sausages into small pieces and fry off.
- Once the sausages have been browned, add the garlic and tomato paste and stir in.
- Once coated, add in the cherry tomatoes and cream cheese, and stir.
- Put the sausages on a medium heat until the pasta is ready.
- Once the broccoli and pasta is almost cooked, take off the heat and save the pasta water in a pouring jug.
- Add the broccoli and pasta to the sausages and stir in.
- Then re-add the pasta water to the mix until it's just about covered.
- Simmer for about 20 mins, until the pasta is thoroughly cooked and the water reduced.
- Salt and pepper to taste.
- For extra heat, add some chilli flakes, which is really nice.
