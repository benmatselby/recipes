## Ingredients

- 300g spaghetti
- 100g pancetta
- 100g hard cheese (pecorino or/and parmesan)
- 50g butter
- 3 large eggs
- 2/3 garlic cloves
- Salt and pepper

## Method

- Boil the spaghetti in salted water.
- Crush the garlic and put in a wok/pan with the butter.
- Fry off the pancetta in the pan with the garlic and butter.
- Cook on medium heat for about 5-7 minutes until the pancetta is golden.
- Beat the eggs in a large bowl, and crack in some pepper.
- Mix the cheese (grated) in with the eggs.
- When the spaghetti is cooked, take all the pans off the heat.
- Remove the garlic from the pancetta.
- Using tongs, put the spaghetti into the pan with the pancetta.
  - Don't worry if you're pulling in pasta water too, that's kind of required.
- Once all the spaghetti is in the pan, put the pasta water to one side.
- Quickly mix the eggs and cheese mix in with the spaghetti.
- Using the tongs, make sure the egg/cheese mix is coating all of the spaghetti.
- Keep moving the mixture around.
- Put 2 or 3 tablespoons of pasta water into the spaghetti to get a creamy consistency with the Spaghetti (not runny or wet).
- Serve up and crack some extra pepper over the top if you wish.
